title: Welcome to 3nd NDN Hackathon

The NDN Team is organizing our 3nd NDN Hackathon to be held on November 4-5, 2016 on the Colorado State University Campus in Fort Collins, CO.  We solicit Hackathon project proposals that advance the state of NDN.  Participants will have approximately **12 hours** to work on the projects.

We encourage projects that:

 - directly address NDN research needs,
 - create new NDN tools or modify existing tools,
 - create or improve documentation and how-to guides.
